[9 Feburary 2010 - Revision 104]
	CHG: ZETextControl render function is micro optimized.
	FIX: ZETextControl text wrap behevior fixed.
	ADD: ZEInputBinding's ZE_IBS_PRESSED, ZE_IBS_RELEASED and ZE_IBS_ALL button state beheviors implamented into DirectInput.
	FIX: ZEPlayer's movement key bindings's buttosn state changed from ZE_IBS_PRESS to ZE_IBS_ALL.
	
[16 Feburary 2010 - Revision 105]
	CHG: ZESoundResource design improved according to v0.05 general design.
	ADD: GetLength function added to ZESoundResource which returns length of the sound sample in milliseconds.
	FIX: ZEResourceFile::Seek function ZESeekFrom::ZE_SF_END does not worked correctly due a bug in the function. Fixed.
	FIX: ZEPartialResourceFile::Seek function also suffers from ZESeekFrom::ZE_SF_END.
	ADD: ZESoundSource dived in to sub classes ZESoundSourceWAV, ZESoundSourceOGG and ZESoundSourceMP3.

[22 Feburary 2010 - Revision 106]
	ADD: ZEContainer added to ZEMeta system.
	ADD: Sound Source Types added to sound system.
	ADD: Common Source Types defined such as Effect, Music, Dialog, Video, Player Communication. User can also define his/her sound source type.
	ADD: Each Source Type volume can be controlled through Sound Module.
	ADD: Sound System integrated with options.
	ADD: Master Volume, Effect Volume, Music Volume, Dialog Volume, Video Volume, Player Communication Volume hass ben added as options.
	DEF: Volume options are non linear. Values below 50 are almost unhearable.
	ADD: Streaming disabled property added. If disable streaming is enabled every sound source becomes unstreamed.
